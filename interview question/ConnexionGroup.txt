Coding:

1.Count the frequency of all character of a given String.
   -> String str  = "MAYANK";
    String[] strArray = str.split("");
    Arrays.stream(strArray).collect(Collectors.groupingBy(Function.identity(),Collectors.counting())).forEach((a,b) -> System.out.print(a + "--->" + b));

2. Find the sum of square of all the odd element from a list.
  -> Integer sumOfSquare = list.stream().filter(e-> e%2 != 0).map(e-> e*e).collect(Collectors.summingInt(Integer::valueOf));

3. 10th highest salary.
	Employee (id(PK), name)
	Salary (emp_id(FK), SALARY)

->Select e1.name from employee e1 inner join salary s on e1.id == s.emp_id
where (Select count(distinct(e2.salary)) from e2 employee where e2.salary > e1.salary) = 9;

4. Remove all odd prime number from a list and print the same list.
