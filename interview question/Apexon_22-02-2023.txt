First round - 5 years of experience

Difference between
=============================
Fail fast and fail safe iterator
HashMap and Concurrent hashmap
Not null and not empty
Eager Loading and Lazy loading


WH Question
=============================
1.Validation on Pojo class using annotation (String name, String password, Date dateOfBirth)
#name should not contain any special character or number
#password should contain at least 8 character : 1 special, 1 number, 1 character
#dateOfBirth should be greater than 18 years and it should be a previous date not current date
2.How do you handle exception in SpringBoot application? Tell me the name of annotation used.
3.Which collection will you choose in multithreaded environment for consistency : HashMap or ConcurrentHashMap
4.which one of these collections is Fail fast and fail-safe : ConcurrentHashMap,  HashMap
5.how to ignore hibernate autoconfiguration or any configuration in springboot
6.which exception is thrown during fail-fast
7.New feature in Java 8 - LocalDateTime
8.Ternary operator and how to use it?
9.Eureka service discovery
10.Spring Security
11. API gateway




Code
==============================
1. Design and implement a HitCounter class that keeps track of requests (or hits) for any URL.It should support the following operations:
record(url, timestamp): records a hit that happened at timestamp for a particular URL
int total(url): returns the total number of hits recorded of the provided URL
int range(url, lower, upper): returns the number of hits that occurred between timestamps lower and upper (inclusive) for a particular URL
Note:Use exact same names as above mentioned.You donâ€™t have any databases to store the data. Use appropriate data structure for the same.

2.
 public class Employee {
    private List<Address> addressList;
}

write a sql query to fetch the address of an employee based on name;
write jpa query for this;
